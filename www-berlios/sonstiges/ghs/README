PLEASE READ THIS CAREFULLY !!!

GHS (Gentoo-Help-System) is still in development.
Please install it only on Computers, where you have
the ability to experiment with Apache and ht://dig.

REQUIREMENTS

Before installing the Gentoo-Help-System, please make
sure, that you have
	- Apache installed with CGI-support
	- ht://dig installed
	
If you already have it installed, then please backup your
files. The install-script owerwrites the configuration
files of ht://dig and ist databases.


- Make sure, that the httpd-directory is /home/httpd (GHS is
  using this Path at the moment)

- Make sure, that the ht://dig configuration resides in
  /etc/htdig (GHS is using this Path at the moment)
  
If the last two points don't fit to you, then please
adapt the installation-script install.sh

Also take a look at this file, if you want to know, how
GHS is initialized and where it puts its files; actually, 
GHS creates a Symlink to /usr/share/doc in Apaches htdocs-dir.
