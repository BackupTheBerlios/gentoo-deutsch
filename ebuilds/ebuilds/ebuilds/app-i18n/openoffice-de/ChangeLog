*openoffice-de-1.0.0-r1 (11 Jul 2002)

    11 Jul 2002; C.Rietzschel <cr@daRav.de> openoffice-de-1.0.0-r1.ebuild :
    only changed everything to take german OO and german spell.
    Seems that the orignal ebuild has some options to install with another 
    language. But the help in german would be very good :)
