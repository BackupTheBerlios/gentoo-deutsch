# Global config file for vdr rc-scripts

# The plugin uses libdvdcss to access CSS protected DVDs. The library
# provides three methods to decrypt the title keys. It is strongly
# recommended to use the "key" methode, as it will yield the best stability
# and speed results (Note: doing so might be illegal in some countries).
# The decryption method can be selected by setting an environment
# variable before starting vdr:
#export DVDCSS_METHOD=key

# If your DVD isn't at the default place /dev/dvd
# please set the current device here
_EXTRAOPTS="-C/dev/cdrom"
