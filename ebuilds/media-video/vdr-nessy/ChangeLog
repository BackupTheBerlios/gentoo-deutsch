*vdr-nessy-1.1.17 (22 Apr 2003)
  22 Apr 2003; M.Hierling <mad@cc.fh-lippe.de> vdr-nessy-1.1.17.ebuild
  vdr-nessy added, it is similar to AIO, but no patch instead a full 
  portion of source code, and because of much changes in vdr source
  the version hangs a little bit behind ...

  Added initial ChangeLog which should be updated whenever the package is
  updated in any way. This changelog is targetted to users. This means that
  the comments should well explained and written in clean English. The
  details about writing correct changelogs are explained in the
  skel.ChangeLog file which you can find in the root directory of the
  portage repository.
